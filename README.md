# Active-Suspension-Control-System-State-Space-Pole-Placement-LQR
This folder contains my **Advanced Control Systems (Control 2)** project, where we modeled, analyzed, and controlled a **2-DOF active car suspension system** using state-space modeling, transfer functions, pole placement, and LQR. Simulations were performed using **MATLAB &amp; Simulink**.
